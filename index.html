    <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
    <p>
        I am 22 years old and I am originally from Cedar Rapids, IA. I am the youngest of my family which consistes of my dad (Greg), mom (Marci), sisters (Taylor and Melanie) and myself.
        I grew up a huge sports fan and enjoyed going to a lot of Iowa Hawkeye sporting events. I also participated in many sports and activities growing up such as baseball, basketball, football, choir, show choir and more. I graduated from Xavier High School in 2018. After spending
        a year at Creighton University in Omaha, NE, I transfered to the University of Iowa. <br>
        <br>
        I currently am a Senior in the Tippie College of Business at The University of Iowa. I am majoring in Business Analytics & Information Systems and Management with a minor in Sports
        Recreation and Management. I am currently a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity here at Iowa and have served as our Academic Chairman and Standards Chairman over the past year.
        In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends and my girlfriend (Caitlin). I really enjoy watching tv, movies, and sporting events, as well as going out to dinner and cheering on the Hawkeyes. 
        I will graduate in May of 2022. After graduation, I hope to find a career where I can utilize data in a formal leadership position.
